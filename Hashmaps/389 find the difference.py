#We iterate through both strings exactly once: O(n) where n is the length of string s
#All operations on the hashmap (insert, get, check) are O(1) on average due to Pythonâ€™s built-in dictionary implementation using hash tables
#thus the overall time complexity is O(n)

#We're storing the frequency of characters from string s in a dictionary.
#Since the input is guaranteed to be lowercase English letters, the maximum number of keys in the dictionary is 26.
#thus the total space complexity is O(1) in terms of the number of unique characters.
