#the time complexity is O(n+m) where we're building a set of jewels O(m)
#and then we're iterating through stones O(n) and when we check in set it is O(1)
#the total time complexity is O(n+m)

#We're storing the set of jewel types â†’ at most 26 characters if restricted to lowercase letters.
#So, worst-case space is O(m)
